# HP-quiz
A Harry Potter quiz

I made this quiz. Its showcases use of Javascript, html and css. 

It asks some questions, some multiple choice and text input and shows the resulting score to the user when they click submit. 
A different message and 1 of 4 related pictures will be shown depending on the users score.
